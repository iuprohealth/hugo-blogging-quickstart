## Behavior Change Goal

My goal is to make a routine out of practicing English vocabulary, using the "**Anki**" flash card application.

Put simply, I want to build a habit from:

1. Record new words as I read[^1]
2. Turn words into flashcards
3. Practice with the flashcards

### Software

*Anki* is a flashcard program based on the idea of [spaced repetition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition).

- [Anki - Website](https://apps.ankiweb.net/)
- [Anki - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anki_(software))
- [Anki - GitHub](https://github.com/ankitects/anki)

### What does success look like?

I am curious about:

- Frequency of use (go from zero use to daily)
- Built-in metrics that Anki tracks
- Methods for evaluating whether I'm improving

## Background

I started scratching words I didn't recognize onto index cards a while back.

There's a "*law*" in complex systems (and many other places) called [Zipf's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law), where the second-most common word in a language half as often as the most common word in a language. By extrapolation, there is a long tail of words that I could discovery simply by keeping an eye out for them.

## Footnotes

[^1]: I'm less concerned with *how quickly* I'm adding new words, and more concerned with *doing something* with them.
